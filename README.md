This project builds an **Agentic AI system** that analyzes and summarizes video content using **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** and **PhiData**. The system allows users to upload video files, ask specific questions, and receive detailed insights generated by the AI agent. It combines **multimodal AI capabilities** (video and text processing) with **web research** to provide comprehensive and actionable responses.

2. **AI-Powered Insights**:
   - The **Agent** (powered by PhiData) analyzes the video content and answers user queries.
   - It uses **DuckDuckGo** for additional web research to enhance responses.

3. **Interactive Interface**:
   - Built with **Streamlit**, the app provides a user-friendly interface for uploading videos, asking questions, and viewing results.

4. **Temporary File Handling**:
   - Uploaded videos are temporarily stored and processed, ensuring efficient resource management.

5. **Detailed Responses**:
   - The AI generates markdown-formatted responses, providing clear and actionable insights.
